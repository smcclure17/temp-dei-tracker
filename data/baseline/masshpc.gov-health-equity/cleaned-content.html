The HPC’s overall goal is better health and better care – at a lower cost – <strong>for all residents </strong>across the Commonwealth.</p><p>The HPC’s 2012 statute explicitly directs the agency to address health care disparities:</p><div><p><em>“The commission shall establish goals that are intended to <strong>reduce health care disparities</strong> in racial, ethnic and disabled communities and in doing so shall seek to incorporate the recommendations of the health disparities council and the office of health equity.”</em></p></div><p>The HPC is committed to addressing these disparities while advancing health equity and promoting social and economic justice.</p><div><h2><strong>Imperative for Action</strong></h2><p><em><strong>In 2020, the disparate impact of COVID-19 on communities of color and ongoing injustices of police brutality across the country exposed systemic racism and deeply embedded structural inequities.</strong></em></p><p>Health inequities in the Commonwealth have been well documented by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH), the Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA), the Office of the Attorney General, the HPC, and others. </p><p>Racial inequities are not unique to the health care system but are reflected in persistent health disparities and increased disease burden for communities of color. In addition to their impact on health and well-being, inequities result in higher health care spending and an imbalanced distribution of resources.</p></div><h2><strong>Racism Directly Affects Health Outcomes</strong></h2><p>The social determinants of health (SDOH) are factors that contribute to an individual’s medical and behavioral health outcomes and to predicting population health (e.g., socioeconomic status, food access, education, and opportunity for employment). While structural inequities and prejudices such as homophobia, ableism, and xenophobia have impacts on SDOH, racism has been proven to also have a direct and harmful impact on health.</p><p><strong>Racism both influences social determinants and is an independent factor in health outcomes.</strong></p><p>It is pivotal to acknowledge and address the impact of systemic racism as health equity work is implemented.</p><figure><img alt="Racism impacts social capital, education, transportation, employment, food access, health behaviors, socioeconomic status, environmental exposure, access to health services, housing, and public safety.

The HPC actively seeks opportunities to align, partner, and support other state agencies, the health care system, and organizations working for health equity on these goals.</li><li>The HPC’s work is <strong>informed and guided by those with lived experience</strong> of inequities.</li><li>The HPC <strong>embeds health equity concepts</strong> in all aspects of its work and <strong>applies all four of its core strategies</strong> to the goal of advancing health equity in the Commonwealth: research and report, convene, watchdog, and partner.</li></ul><img alt="Image of the HPC Logo with text on each shape.

In addition, the <a href="/opp">Office of Patient Protection</a> (housed within the HPC) works to effectively safeguard health care consumer protections in the Commonwealth and assists customers in many languages.</p><p><strong>Ongoing HPC work focusing on health equity is highlighted in the sections below and will be updated as needed.</strong></p><div><div><h3><button>Research and Report</button></h3><div><div><ul><li>The HPC leverages <strong>research publications</strong> to elevate topics that call out inequities in the health care system (e.g., DataPoints issues on <a href="/publications/datapoints-series/issue-20-oral-health-access-and-equity-commonwealth">oral health access and equity</a> and <a href="/publications/datapoints-series/issue-24-persistent-cost-sharing-contraception-massachusetts-2017">persistent cost-sharing for contraception</a>; Report on <a href="/sites/default/files/2023-04/Telehealth%20Use%20in%20the%20Commonwealth%20and%20Policy%20Recommendations_0.pdf">Telehealth Use in the Commonwealth<span><span> (opens in a new tab)</span></span></a>; Chartpack on <a href="/publications/policyresearch-brief/health-care-workforce-trends-and-challenges-era-covid-19">Health Care Workforce Trends and Challenges in the Era of COVID-19</a>).

The Advisory Council includes a diverse group of health care leaders who meet quarterly to discuss the most important health policy issues of the day. The HPC has prioritized broadening and diversifying the membership of this body over the last 10 years, to encompass more perspectives and lived experiences with the health care system.
