## Here to help you build community.
![](https://web.uri.edu/diversity/wp-content/uploads/sites/1859/52809977389_e4d2f23e60_b.jpg) ![A picture with URI logo and blue and white pom poms at check-in table](https://web.uri.edu/diversity/wp-content/uploads/sites/1859/rhody-acn-picture.jpg) ![](https://web.uri.edu/diversity/wp-content/uploads/sites/1859/52809228772_f5187c2950_b.jpg) **Let’s consider what could be.**
We celebrate and amplify the significant and unique contributions of each and every member of the URI community.
URI is deeply committed to cultivating an academic, working, and living environment that promotes inclusive excellence. We believe that we have much to learn from one another and we are dedicated to providing the means to making that happen through policy-making, programming, critical conversations, thoughtful action, and collaboration between administration, faculty, staff, and students. 
The Office of Community, Equity and Diversity (CED) is here to support you and to connect you with the people and resources to be successful at URI.
We’re glad you’re here.
