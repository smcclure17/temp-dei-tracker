In every aspect of our community, Holy Cross champions diversity, equity, and inclusion.
As a Jesuit, Catholic liberal arts college, we know that the best way to understand the world around us is to embrace the full spectrum of perspectives and life experiences. To that end, we welcome students, staff and faculty members of every gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status and gender identity. We also encourage all community members to think critically about disparities in social structures, and to take action toward positive change.
