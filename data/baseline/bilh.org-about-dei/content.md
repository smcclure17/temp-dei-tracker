  * Diversity, Equity & Inclusion


## Exceptional Care for Everyone
BILH's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) vision is to transform care delivery by dismantling barriers to equitable health outcomes and becoming the premier health system to attract, retain, and develop diverse talent. 
Fostering a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) across our hospitals and practices strengthens our communities. It helps us better serve you and the more than 1 million people in eastern Massachusetts who rely on us for care.
Our goal is to ensure everyone has access to providers and services that honors their social, cultural and language needs. You can rely on us to provide exceptional care regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, disability status or financial situation.

### Our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Office
The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Office at Beth Israel Lahey Health directs our efforts to embrace all we serve. The office develops and advocates for policies, processes and business practices that benefit you, our communities and our workforce. 
### Hair Care for All
We believe that providing care products for every hair type and texture can transform patients’ experiences at our facilities.
The DEI team at Beth Israel Lahey Health has partnered with Dudley’s, a Minority, Black-Owned Business (MBE) specializing in beauty products, who will supply inclusive hair care products at all BILH locations.
Whether it’s shampoo, conditioner, detangler, a wide-tooth comb or body lotion, our patients now have access to products that match their unique hair types and needs.
If you are an inpatient at a BILH hospital, please ask us about Hair Care for All.
