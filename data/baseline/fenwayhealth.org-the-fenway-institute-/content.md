### **The mission of The Fenway Institute is to optimize health and well-being for sexual and gender minorities (SGM) and those affected by HIV.**
Our key commitment is to address the specific health needs of sexual and gender minorities (SGM) and people affected by HIV. To that end, we engage and foster collaborations with diverse community and professional stakeholders; conduct and disseminate research; design and deliver education, training, and technical assistance; develop and promote empirically-supported public policies; and work to cultivate and nurture a multidisciplinary and diverse community of faculty and staff. Honoring the intersectionality of identities and lived experience, and taking action to advance racial equity and social justice are central components of this commitment.
