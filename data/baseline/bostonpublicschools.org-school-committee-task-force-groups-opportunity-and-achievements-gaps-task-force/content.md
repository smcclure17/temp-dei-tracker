# Opportunity and Achievements Gaps Task Force
**The Boston Public Schools aspires to be "a district of all high-performing schools, eliminating both the opportunity gap and the achievement gap"** (_Boston School Committee's Strategic Vision for the Boston Public Schools, 2015_).
In 2016, the Boston School Committee unanimously approved the **[Policy of the Boston Public Schools to Eliminate Opportunity and Achievement Gaps for Students of Color, English Language Learners, Students with Disabilities, and Students of Low Socio-Economic Status.](https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/school-committee/task-force-groups/</fs/resource-manager/view/0ca7c792-469f-4c29-8559-31137c332dc8>) **The policy was developed by the Committee's Opportunity and Achievement Gaps (OAG) Task Force. Read more about the charge, priority goals, and leadership of the OAG Task Force[ here](https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/school-committee/task-force-groups/</fs/resource-manager/view/2f22be03-6e4b-4792-9062-161c19e4686d>). [Grupo de Trabajo para Brechas de Oportunidad y Rendimiento Académico](https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/school-committee/task-force-groups/</fs/resource-manager/view/2ca0cced-5138-4505-b24b-0424593f30e1>)
In 2018, the OAG Task Force unanimously approved the [BPS Investment Framework](https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/school-committee/task-force-groups/</fs/resource-manager/view/e342b32a-1e61-4f4d-9a6d-089ef2156a6b>) as an addendum to the OAG policy. The investment framework was developed by the district's Budget Equity Working Group with the intention of identifying and addressing areas of inequity in the BPS budget. It accomplishes this by suggesting system-wide and school-led investment priorities that are based on the principles of equity and by suggesting continuously increasing the impact of existing spending through the lens of equity.
**SY23-24 OAG Task Force Virtual Meeting Schedule**
