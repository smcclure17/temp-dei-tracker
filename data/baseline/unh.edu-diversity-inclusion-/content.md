Diversity, Equity, Access & Inclusion at UNH
![UNH Students on Campus](https://www.unh.edu/diversity-inclusion/sites/default/files/styles/landscape_480x260/public/media/2022-03/unh-students-congreve-autumn.jpg?h=f726d886&itok=7JcbVxji)
## **The Division of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is pleased to offer our community this compilation of UNH DEAI offices, resources, events, and information.**
##  UNH Diversity Statement
The University of New Hampshire is committed to building and nurturing an environment of inclusive excellence where all students, faculty, and staff can thrive. We also are committed to providing open and inclusive access for all alumni, volunteers, learners, employees, and visitors seeking to participate in our programs and activities. We venture to sustain a campus environment that fosters mutual respect and understanding. We believe diversity, equity, accessibility, and inclusion are foundational values inextricably linked to achieving our core educational mission and embrace the many characteristics of our community members that make them uniquely themselves. Here, you belong, and all are welcome.
## Statement on Race-neutral Admissions
On June 29, 2023, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that race cannot be considered in college admissions decisions. Through our admissions policies at the University of New Hampshire, we strive to enroll students who represent the diversity of experience, background and thought that foster an intellectually stimulating and well-rounded collegiate experience. Since 2012, New Hampshire state law has prohibited preferential treatment based on race and other protected categories in public sector recruiting, hiring, promotion and collegiate admissions. Although the court decision will not impact UNH policies, which are already neutral on race in compliance with state law, we recognize the challenges this decision poses to colleges and universities across the United States and the ways it may impede access for groups already underrepresented in higher education and diminish overall educational experiences.
Diversity is critical to the university’s community to bring together those who have varying values and a range of life experiences to share that can enhance intellectual debate to help our students, and faculty, grow and build new relationships that prepare them for a future and world beyond campus.

### UNH Land, Water & Life Acknowledgement
As we all journey on the trail of life, we wish to acknowledge the spiritual and physical connection the Pennacook, Abenaki, and Wabanaki Peoples have maintained to N’dakinna (homeland) and the aki (land), nebi (water), olakwika (flora), and awaasak (fauna) which the University of New Hampshire community is honored to steward today. We also acknowledge the hardships they continue to endure after the loss of unceded homelands and champion the university’s responsibility to foster relationships and opportunities that strengthen the well-being of the Indigenous People who carry forward the traditions of their ancestors.

There aren’t a lot of white people in the Bronx, Santos says. At UNH, it is just the opposite. But it wasn’t the lack of a diverse population that she found challenging; it was the small things, like figures of speech and expressions. Her plan to become a doctor is rooted in her experience growing up in the Dominican Republic where access to medical care is limited.
