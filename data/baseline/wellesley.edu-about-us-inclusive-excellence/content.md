We believe inclusion and excellence are fundamental to education.
When we create the conditions that make every person feel included, we make it possible for all to excel. Each of our students deserves equity in how they are mentored, sponsored, supported, and empowered to experience Wellesley. We are dedicated to ensuring that they all thrive in Wellesley’s rich learning and living environment.
Faculty promote inclusive excellence in their classrooms by developing rigorous pedagogies that foster students’ ability to listen and learn across differences. Staff embrace this shared value as well—from the Office of Admission recruiting brilliant applicants who represent a vibrant mix of backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences, to Student Life working to ensure that all students feel they belong here, to Career Education helping students explore professional goals or discover a new path. 
##  Specialized offices and programs Help Advance our mission of inclusive excellence
