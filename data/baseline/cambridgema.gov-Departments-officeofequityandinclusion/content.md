## Hours of Service

Tue - Thu: 8:30AM - 5PM
Fri: 8:30AM - 12PM
The Office of Equity and Inclusion (OEI) upholds, reaffirms, and guides the City’s commitment to equal employment opportunity; helps City departments build and support a workforce that continually reflects the diversity of the people the City serves; and conceptualizes and cultivates equity and inclusion as singular organizational priorities, placing these principles at the heart of what the City’s workforce does. All of this, in turn, helps the City of Cambridge to both maintain a workplace culture where all employees can flourish and deliver high-quality, exceptional customer service to all.
OEI’s work includes, among other things, monitoring all equal employment opportunity and non-discrimination laws to ensure compliance, and monitoring the workplace climate for the presence of behaviors, actions, inactions and personal interactions that may lead City of Cambridge employees to feel disrespected, devalued, or unwelcomed. Further, OEI maintains and evaluates demographic data and processes workforce reports for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; ensures adherence to Affirmative Action Plan goals; investigates formal complaints of alleged discrimination; and reviews and approves construction bids for compliance with the Minority Business Enterprise Program. In addition to these legal and regulatory compliance actions -- vital and bedrock components of OEI’s work in support of both the City and its employees -- the department uses a four-pronged approach and strategic directions to accomplish its overall mission and achieve its goals:
  * OEI provides structure for all City diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives by formally aligning the City’s personnel policies in support of equity and inclusion.
  * OEI advances departmental level implementation of diversity, equity and inclusion Efforts through its Equity and Inclusion Partner (EIP) Project.
  * OEI facilitates and institutionalizes increased antiracism, diversity, equity and Inclusion training for staff at all levels.
  * OEI collaborates with the City Manager’s Office to equip leadership and management staff with adaptive and cultural competency skills through targeted and continuous learning and best practices seminars.

## Tips and FAQs
###  What is the Minority Business Enterprise Program (MBE)? 
The Equity & Inclusion Department monitors construction contracts in excess of $50,000 to ensure that at least 10 percent of contract or sub-contract business is awarded to minority owned businesses certified by the Commonwealth's Supplier Diversity Office (SDO).
###  What is the Affirmative Action Advisory Committee (AAAC)? 
The Affirmative Action Advisory Committee serves as a resource to City departments and constituencies concerned with Affirmative Action (AA) and fair labor/employment practices. The Committee reviews developments in the law which impact the City's Affirmative Action efforts; advises the City Manager, Equity & Inclusion Director and City departments on how legal changes affect current initiatives; provides assistance in updating and monitoring progress of the City's Affirmative Action Plan; provides assistance to the City in its recruitment efforts; and offers additional assistance to further the City's affirmative action efforts.
