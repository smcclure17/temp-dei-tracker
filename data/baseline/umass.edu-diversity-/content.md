Imagining 2034: Our Strategic Plan
The university's multi-stage strategic planning process will be informed by a respect for UMass Amherst’s rich history as the commonwealth’s flagship campus and public-land grant institution, ambition for excellence in all we do, and recognition of our responsibility to steward our financial and human resources.
