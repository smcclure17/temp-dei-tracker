#  SDO Certified Diverse Business Dashboard
The Supplier Diversity Office (SDO) is proud to announce the Certified Diverse Business Dashboard, which is a map of certified diverse businesses in Massachusetts! This tool will enable state agencies, cities and towns and prime contractors to locate certified diverse businesses based on location as well as other criteria. This can be especially helpful for projects needing subcontractors who do business in a certain area.

## **Dashboard Instructions**
### **How the display works:**
  * Dashboard displays Massachusetts businesses only in the map format; out of state businesses are still searchable but not within the confines of the map.
  * Areas showing darker colors have a higher number of certified businesses.
  * Areas with a duller/paler color have fewer certified businesses.
  * Under the map, your search results are displayed showing the company name, city, county, and contact information.
  * Click on a business underneath the map to see its certification type displayed on the right of the map.


### **Using a screen reader with Power BI reports:**
