# Anti-racism Resources
Systemic racism anywhere is unacceptable, and particularly in a medical school dedicated to the principles of equity and to providing care without exception. We are committed to working together to become an institution that is anti-racist, diverse, and equitable, building on our rich history of inclusion and commitment to social justice.
### Here are offices, resources and programs that may be helpful to you as we move forward with this important work.

![](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/camed/files/2020/07/Kendi.png)Ibram X. Kendi, PhD, Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities and Founding Director of the BU Center for Antiracist Research, was asked in a recent interview what people could do to support our communities of color and try to change a system deeply rooted in inequality, racism, and murder.
There is no single answer, he responded, except this: _“Get involved after the marches and rallies. Invest your time and money in community-based programs that work. Support Black and brown-owned businesses.”_

[The United State of Anxiety](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/camed/about/anti-racism-resources/<https:/www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/anxiety>)
  * A show about the unfinished business of our history and its grip on our future. It works to connect the present with the past. Underlying almost every cultural divide and fervent debate as we approach the 2020 election is one basic question: Who is the USA for? Who’s allowed to live here? Who has control over whose body? Who gets to vote? Who gets access to a good public education? Who sets the definition of justice? Our states may be united into a nation, but we have never agreed on answers to these basic questions. At times, it feels like a civil war. The arguments we’re having now started in the aftermath of the actual Civil War, when Americans set out to do something no other country had tried before: to build the world’s first multiracial democracy.
