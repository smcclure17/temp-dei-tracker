# Diverse and Culturally Responsive Workforce
As outlined in the [educational vision ](https://www.doe.mass.edu/csi/diverse-workforce/</commissioner/vision/vision-supports.pdf>), the Department partners with districts, schools, and programs to develop and sustain a workforce that is diverse, culturally responsive, well-prepared, and committed to continuous improvement so that all students have equitable access to effective educators. Districts, schools, and programs feel empowered and prepared to: 
  * 3.1 Develop an increased and robust pipeline of diverse and well-prepared educators and leaders.
  * 3.2 Create the conditions to sustain and retain diverse and effective staff, particularly those who entered the field through alternative pathways.
  * 3.3 Implement opportunities for all staff to engage in a cycle of continuous improvement, utilizing effective teaming structures.


A growing body of educational research demonstrates the positive influences of teachers of color on short- and long-term academic outcomes of students of color - with research finding that having a single teacher of color can boost academic achievement, high school graduation rates, and college enrollment for students of color (Dee, 2004; Gershenson, 2018).
The Department is deeply committed to providing aligned support to districts, schools, and programs so that this vision may become a reality and will continue to work with districts, schools, and educators to promote teaching and learning that is antiracist, inclusive, multilingual, and multicultural; that values and affirms each student and their families; and that creates equitable opportunities and experiences for all students, particularly those who have been historically underserved. 
![Line graph showing a steady percentage increase in the racial and ethnic diversity of students, educators, and superintendents in Massachusetts between fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2024.](https://www.doe.mass.edu/images/csi/diverse-workforce.jpg)
Here are some of the ways we're supporting that work:
## [Aspiring Principals Fellowship](https://www.doe.mass.edu/csi/diverse-workforce/</csi/diverse-workforce/aspiring-principals.html>)
The Massachusetts Aspiring Principal Fellowship is a one-year program for aspiring school leaders that seeks to cultivate a strong and diverse pipeline of effective school principals who are committed to championing culturally and linguistically sustaining learning communities, equity-driven leadership, and anti-racist practices.
## [Influence 100](https://www.doe.mass.edu/csi/diverse-workforce/</csi/diverse-workforce/influence100.html>)
A fellowship program designed for current administrators to increase the racial and ethnic diversity of superintendents in Massachusetts and create more culturally responsive districts and leaders.
## [InSPIRED Initiative](https://www.doe.mass.edu/csi/diverse-workforce/</csi/diverse-workforce/inspired.html>)
The InSPIRED Initiative connects current educators to work with DESE to help cultivate, support, and retain a culturally responsive and diverse educator workforce in Massachusetts schools through the InSPIRED Fellowship and the Statewide Affinity Network.
## [Partners in Equity Leadership Conference](https://www.doe.mass.edu/csi/diverse-workforce/</csi/diverse-workforce/partners-in-equity.html>)
This biannual conference brings together equity leaders from across Massachusetts to provide deeper learning, resources, and networking opportunities.
## [Registered Teacher Apprenticeship Program](https://www.doe.mass.edu/csi/diverse-workforce/</csi/diverse-workforce/teacher-apprenticeship/default.html>)
This program offers a low-cost, accessible path to becoming a teacher, combining on-the-job training with classroom learning to help build a more diverse and culturally responsive teaching workforce in Massachusetts.
## [Teacher Diversification Grant (for schools and districts)](https://www.doe.mass.edu/csi/diverse-workforce/</csi/diverse-workforce/pilot-grant.html>)
This competitive grant provides financial funding to support school and district efforts to create, strengthen, and or reinforce and diversify existing teacher recruitment and retention programs.
## [Teacher Diversification Guidebook](https://www.doe.mass.edu/csi/diverse-workforce/</csi/diverse-workforce/guidebook.html>)
This guidebook provides a framework to help district and school leaders design and implement a teacher diversification strategy to improve student achievement and create equitable outcomes.
## [Teacher Diversification Professional Learning Community](https://www.doe.mass.edu/csi/diverse-workforce/</csi/diverse-workforce/community.html>)
A network that supports and enhances school and district understanding of the components needed to develop and implement a comprehensive talent diversification strategy (recruitment, selection, and retention) centered on cultural proficiency.
