# Health Equity Accelerator
## Boston Medical Center is driving the future of health equity
The Health Equity Accelerator at Boston Medical Center is working to transform healthcare to eliminate gaps in life expectancy and quality of life among different races and ethnicities. We've started working in five clinical areas where we see major disparities.

## EQTY 2024 was a success!
In September we hosted EQTY 2024: Accelerating Health Justice, where medical and community leaders across the healthcare landscape convened to showcase innovations, share their expertise, and inspire the future of health equity.

## Help us in our fight for health justice
We're proud to be featured in the Healthier Together series, which explores the untold stories of resilience, compassion, and innovation in health systems across the world. The mini documentary spotlights BMC's commitment to health equity, thanks to a production for the MassMutual Foundation by BBCStoryworks Commercial Productions. The MassMutual Foundation is a generous BMC supporter. 
Watch the film to see BMC leaders Thea James, MD, MBA, and Sara Stulac, MD, share how BMC is reimagining healthcare with innovative services and programs that allow all patients to thrive.

## Showcasing BMC's Leadership in Social Impact 
“[We are] continuing to lead by example of what it means to shift from a charity-based model to an equity-focused model… so that the way we are investing in our community brings about the greatest community assets and agency and empowers people at the local level to make decisions that work for them and their family and uplift them generationally.” 
In an episode of FinThrive, Sheila Phicil, director of innovation at BMC's Health Equity Accelerator, discusses how we're making strides in closing racial health equity gaps and improving patient outcomes.
