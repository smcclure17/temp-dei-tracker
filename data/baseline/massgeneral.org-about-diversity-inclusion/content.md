[Report on Equity in Health Care](https://www.massgeneral.org/about/<https:/www.mghdisparitiessolutions.org/equity-in-health-care-quality>)
_Diversity is the richness of human differences. Inclusion is when everyone feels connected, valued and engaged. At Massachusetts General Hospital, we believe that because of diversity we excel; through inclusion we respect; focused on equity we serve, heal, educate and innovate._
In the latest installment of the "I am MGH" series, Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Surgery staff explain what diversity means to them and the important role it plays in their lives as clinicians, researchers, educators and students. At Mass General, we believe that because of diversity we excel; through inclusion we respect; focused on equity we serve, heal, educate and innovate.
### I am MGH: Discussing Diversity with surgical resident Numa Perez, MD 
**Why do you feel you belong at Mass General?** I belong because I’ve never felt like I don’t. I’ve never felt out of place or treated differently. I’m given the same opportunities and support. My leadership responds to my emails as fast as anyone else’s. I’ve never felt that I was treated differently because of how I look or because I grew up in El Salvador. I’ve never felt singled out. That’s why I feel I belong here.
### I am MGH: Discussing Diversity with Surgical Resident Sahael Stapleton, MD
**Have you experienced any surprises along the way?**
I think one of the surprises in the hospital is the pretense that you might attribute to someone within the Harvard system doesn’t exist. At all levels, people have the humility to say “I don’t know. Can you teach me?” and ask for help. It doesn’t matter what your title is.
### I am MGH: Discussing Diversity with Surgical Resident Dana Schwartz, MD
**Any advice for future residents? Why should they pick Mass General?** People have very different goals coming into this residency and I don’t think there is one type of MGH resident. There’s not one product they’re trying to mold you into. People really try to understand what your goals and desires are and help you meet those. There are a lot of opportunities here for clinical research training, mentorship or anything you want to pursue is available at Mass General and in Boston.
### I am MGH: Discussing Diversity with Surgical Resident Asishana Osho
**Can you speak to the diversity in Boston and Mass General?** The Surgery residency has changed a lot since I’ve been here. Our diversity numbers are good. When I showed up, there wasn’t very much but as I’m finishing, there is a wealth of diversity. I’ve been involved in the selection process for the next resident group and diversity is clearly important. People are realizing it’s necessary; not just because it’s a thing you want to have but it’s clear from research that having a diverse workforce makes you better. It’s a thing that people acknowledge and recognize here, and something that leadership is certainly striving toward.
### ‘I am MGH’: Stand Against Racism 2019In recognition of the nationwide YWCA Stand Against Racism Day on April 25, Mass General staff share how and why they stand against racism.
### ‘I am MGH’: Who We Are
Whether by train, bus, car, bike, on foot or by internet connection, Mass General staff come together each day with one common goal – providing and supporting the very best in patient care. These individuals bring with them different skills, perspectives, and backgrounds. As part of Mass General’s ongoing focus on diversity and inclusion hospitalwide, staff share their personal stories about what makes them unique, how their differences enhance their ability to help colleagues, patients and visitors to the hospital, and what their goals are for the future.
### Annual Report on Equity in Healthcare Quality
The Mass General Annual Report on Equity in Healthcare Quality monitors several key components of quality by race, ethnicity, and language. It was developed in response to The IOM Report Crossing the Quality Chasm, which identifies equity – the principle that quality of care should not vary by race, ethnicity, or gender, among other characteristics – as one of six pillars of quality. Although race and ethnicity data have been collected routinely at the MGH for several years, this data was not routinely analyzed or reported prior to developing this report in 2005. The AREHQ was one of the first of its kind in the nation and is now produced annually. [Read the annual report.](https://www.massgeneral.org/about/<https:/www.mghdisparitiessolutions.org/equity-in-health-care-quality>)
Peter L. Slavin, MD, former president of Massachusetts General Hospital, delivered a keynote address “Toward a More Just Society and Health Care System: The Role of Academic Medical Centers” at the 126th Association of American Medical Colleges annual meeting.
### Our Commitment to Diversity
Mass General provides a welcoming and supportive environment for employees of all ethnic backgrounds, ages, lifestyles and physical abilities.
