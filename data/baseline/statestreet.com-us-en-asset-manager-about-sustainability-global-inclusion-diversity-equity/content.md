Diversity, equity and inclusion
![Diversity equity and inclusion](https://www.statestreet.com/web/about/sustainability/diversity-equity-and-inclusion.jpg)
We celebrate the diversity of our 50,000+ colleagues worldwide and honor the unique perspectives shaped by their lived experiences.
With a strong commitment to embedding diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) into our corporate culture, we’re embracing our colleagues’ unique identities, experiences and perspectives, and fostering an inclusive environment where everyone feels a sense of belonging.
At State Street, we embrace and encourage differences, including race, color, religion, creed, national origin, ancestry, ethnicity, age, disability, genetic information, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression, citizenship, marital status, domestic partnership or civil union status, familial status, military and veteran status, socioeconomic status, culture and other legally-protected characteristics that make our employees and others with whom we work unique.
We foster psychological safety in the workplace, to help our employees focus on their best work, and State Street remains an employer of choice. 
Our commitment in action

increase in our 2023 spend with Black and Latinx suppliers (compared to the previous year) 
23%

38%

## Demonstrating progress
Advancing racial equity
We are committed to advancing racial equity through our partnerships, programs and priorities.

Diversity goals
Our differences unite us and set the foundation of an inclusive culture. Measuring and reporting on our diversity goals reminds us to drive more equitable representation across the company.

10 actions to address racism and inequality
A more equitable world begins with each of us. In June 2020, we launched our 10-point action plan to address issues of racism and inequality — across our industry and in our communities. Through our 10 Actions, we intend to use our power, voice and capital to help end systemic racism.
[Explore our progress](https://www.statestreet.com/us/en/asset-manager/about/sustainability/</us/en/asset-manager/about/sustainability/global-inclusion-diversity-equity/10-actions-to-address-racism-and-inequality>)
Advancing our civil rights impact
In November 2021, we engaged national civil rights law firm Relman Colfax to conduct an independent Civil Rights audit of our company. The audit focused on products and services, whether our business policies, practices and products/services have advanced Civil Rights for protected classes in the US, and how they might in the future.

Enriching our supplier network
Our program engages with suppliers owned by minorities, women, veterans and the LGBTQ+ and disabled communities. We seek to create opportunities for diverse suppliers to grow their businesses and expand their impact on local communities.

## Industry recognition
From being named to the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index five years in a row, to winning multiple DiversityInc Top 50 Best Companies nods and Seramount awards, we are proud to be recognized for supporting inclusion, diversity and gender equity in the workplace and beyond.

## Our commitment to transparency
Our Equal Employment Opportunity reporting
We have set clear goals to help us improve our diversity and inclusion efforts. Making our EEO-1 data available is just one of the ways that we quantify and report on progress toward those goals. We know we have more work to do, and we are committed to improving.
[View our EEO-1 report](https://www.statestreet.com/us/en/asset-manager/about/sustainability/</us/en/asset-manager/about/sustainability/global-inclusion-diversity-equity/equal-employment-opportunity-data>)
Recognizing potential through equal pay
As part of our commitment to equal pay for work of equal value, we regularly review our pay practices to assess how women are paid compared to men globally, and how employees of color are paid compared to their peers in the US.

From Fearless Girl to strong female leadership
Starting in 2017, our Asset Stewardship team has engaged with companies in our investment portfolio to monitor their approaches to gender diversity and alignment with our expectations.
[Discover our impact](https://www.statestreet.com/us/en/asset-manager/about/sustainability/<https:/www.ssga.com/us/en/institutional/ic/about-us/what-we-do/asset-stewardship/fearless-girl>)
Self-ID program
Our voluntary Self-ID program called “Count Me In” allows us to capture a truer picture of employees in our workplace. Employees can voluntarily update their veteran and disability status, along with their sexual orientation, gender identity and preferred pronoun information (data collection not available in some countries). Analysis of the data allows us to measure the effectiveness of our existing employee programs, create new ones, and helps us to deliver on our commitment to create a more inclusive workplace. 
## Employee networks
Creating connections
Run entirely by our colleagues, our 24 employee networks (many of which have won industry awards) help employees come together around a common goal, share unique perspectives and increase their visibility. They also create networking, mentoring and other professional development opportunities.
