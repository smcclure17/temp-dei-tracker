# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
Our objective at MIT is to promote a workplace of inclusion that welcomes and supports people of varying backgrounds and different viewpoints, experience, talents, and ideas.
By respecting and valuing differences in race, gender, gender identity, ethnicity, age, physical and language abilities, culture, religion, veteran status, sexual orientation, and other identities, opportunities become numerous. Approaches to problem-solving and decision-making are multi-dimensional, leading to success and empowering staff to thrive and do their best work.
While the Institute is committed to meeting the requirements of laws, MIT’s higher commitment is to creating an atmosphere of civility, collegiality, mutual respect, and inclusion that stimulates and supports all employees in their work at MIT.
Our role in Human Resources is to advance staff diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts and to offer assistance in reaching the [goals of affirmative action](https://hr.mit.edu/</diversity-equity-inclusion/aa>) through the following actions:
  * Provide [resources](https://hr.mit.edu/</diversity-equity-inclusion/resources>) on diversity, equity, and inclusion
  * Grow the network of distributed leadership across campus
  * Support MIT's HR professionals with [Affirmative Action data, guidance, tools, and training](https://hr.mit.edu/</diversity-equity-inclusion/aa>)
  * Increase the general knowledge and understanding of diversity and inclusion 
    * We offer both open enrollment and tailored workshops and presentations to the community
    * MIT is committed to Institute support of [Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)](https://hr.mit.edu/<https:/iceo.mit.edu/employee-resource-groups/>), employee-led groups formed around common interests, common bonds, or similar backgrounds.
  * Support the [English for Speakers of other Languages (ESOL) Program](https://hr.mit.edu/</diversity-equity-inclusion/esol>) for MIT Service Employees
  * Ensure a clear and consistent message and maintain the visibility of diversity and inclusion as a MIT priority
  * Embed diversity and inclusion into all relevant MIT practices and processes
  * Pilot tools that will enable individuals and groups to leverage diversity
