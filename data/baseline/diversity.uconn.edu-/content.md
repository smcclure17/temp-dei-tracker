## Message of Welcome
Welcome to the University of Connecticut’s Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice page! This site will serve as the University’s central hub for diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ) information and initiatives. It will provide resources, opportunities for engagement, and celebrations of the many diverse communities who call UConn “home.”
UConn is committed to diversity, a crucial part of the [University's mission.](https://diversity.uconn.edu/<https:/boardoftrustees.uconn.edu/university-mission-statement/>) We also believe that diversity makes our campuses better places to learn and work and positions UConn as a state, regional, and local leader in education, research, and outreach. Quite simply, we believe that the diversity of our communities makes UConn stronger.
The important transformational work related to DEIJ will only be successful if the University has buy-in and input from our entire community; no singular department or unit can do this work on its own. This website provides an entry point for every member of the UConn community – whether a student, alumni, staff, faculty, or a member of the surrounding communities, we invite you to join in this important work with us. Together, we can improve the UConn experience for every member of our community.
### Mission Statement
The University of Connecticut is committed to building a safe and inclusive community for all its members through diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Under the guidance of the Interim Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer, Dr. Jeffrey Hines, we as members of the UConn community aim to listen, reflect, learn, and act to make our community safe and a place of belonging for all. We aim to support diversity, equity, and inclusion through offering support for success for people of all backgrounds.
## Land Acknowledgement
We would like to begin by acknowledging that the land on which we gather is the territory of the Eastern Pequot, Golden Hill Paugussett, Lenape, Mashantucket Pequot, Mohegan, Nipmuc and Schaghticoke Peoples who have stewarded this land throughout the generations. We thank them for their strength and resilience in protecting this land, and aspire to uphold our responsibilities according to their example.

In 1987, at the top of his class and weeks away from graduation, Steffan was forced to resign and sued the Department of Defense, ultimately losing his legal case in 1994. Stefan’s personal papers, correspondence and legal files are a collection in the Law Library Archives. This event will delve into Steffan’s story, the significance of the exhibit, and the broader impact of inclusion and representation in the armed forces.
This event is free and open to the public. Lunch will be provided.

The racial wealth gap in the United States has witnessed alarming growth in recent years, with BIPOC households now possessing less than 25% of the wealth held by their white counterparts. A substantial portion of this wealth gap can be attributed to disparities in housing. Owning a home remains a principal method for building and transferring wealth, constituting approximately 70% of an individual’s net worth. However, challenges such as housing discrimination, restrictive zoning laws, income disparities and lending practices have created barriers to homeownership, particularly for BIPOC individuals and first-time homebuyers.
Real estate lawyers and practitioners have a unique opportunity to address this critical issue by creating new pathways to homeownership for increasingly diverse communities. We invite you to join this critical examination of how real estate law plays a pivotal role in the short-term provision of affordable housing to underserved communities and, in the long term, contributes to the wealth accumulation of Black individuals and families.

[ ![Religious Holidays 
♦ Imbolic \(February 1-2\): This Pagan and Wiccan festival serves as the halfway point between the winter solstice and spring equinox, celebrating fire, light, and the return of life. 
♦ Candlemas \(February 2\): Candlemas is a Christian holiday that occurs 40 days after Christmas. Also known as Presentation of the Lord, Candlemas commemorates Jesus’ presentation at the Temple. For Catholics, in particular, Candlemas honors the purification of the Virgin Mary.
♦ Tu B’Shevat \(February 12 – February 13\): The 15th of the Jewish month of Shevat is the day that marks the beginning of a “new year” for trees. This day marks the season in which the earliest-blooming trees in Israel emerge from their winter sleep and begin a new fruit-bearing cycle
♦ Parinirvana \(February 15\): This day, also known as Nirvana Day, marks the death of the Buddha and his attainment of final Nirvana. Buddhists may observe this day by meditating or by visiting Buddhist temples or monasteries. 
♦ Maha Shivaratri \(February 26 - 27\): The most important sectarian festival of the year for devotees of the Hindu god Shiva. The 14th day of the dark half \(waning moon\) of each lunar month is especially sacred to Shiva, but when it occurs in the month of Magha \(January–February\) and especially in the month of Phalguna \(February–March\), it is an observance of rejoicing.

[ ![Cultural and Federal Holidays 
♦ National Freedom Day \(February 1\): National Freedom Day celebrates the end of slavery in the United States and recognizes the United States as a symbol of liberty. National Freedom Day was proposed in 1941 by Richard Robert Wright, Sr. to commemorate the day President Lincoln signed a Congressional resolution stating that “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.” This resolution would become the Thirteenth Amendment on December 18, 1865. National Freedom Day became a national holiday in 1948. 
♦ World Hijab Day \(February 1\): World Hijab Day was started in 2013 by Nazma Khan, who wanted to foster religious tolerance and understanding by inviting all women to wear a hijab for one day each year. In the decade since, World Hijab Day has grown to promote awareness, education, and empowerment in order to dismantle bigotry, discrimination, and prejudice against Muslim women. World Hijab Day celebrates religious tolerance and women’s rights around the world. 
♦ Valentine’s Day \(February 14\): Valentine’s Day is celebrated annually on February 14. The origins of the holiday are disputed; some accounts point to pagan fertility festivals while others point to St. Valentine, an early Christian saint martyred for performing weddings in defiance of a ban on marriage for military-aged men. Today, Valentine’s Day is typically regarded as a celebration of romantic love. 
♦ Presidents Day \(February 17\): President’s Day, also known as Washington’s Birthday on the federal level and for the State of Connecticut, is celebrated in the United States on the third Monday of February. Established in 1879 to honor Washington’s February 22 birthday, Presidents Day was moved to the third Monday of February in 1970 as part of the Uniform Monday Holidays Act to create more three-day weekends for workers. The holiday now celebrates all US presidents, past and present.](https://production.wordpress.uconn.edu/diversitydraft/wp-content/uploads/sites/3257/sb-instagram-feed-images/476022255_18266550562250914_2592579374359241207_nfull.webp) ](https://diversity.uconn.edu/<https:/www.instagram.com/p/DFlgKDwBtsw/>)

[ ![The Office for Diversity and Inclusion and the Provost’s Office would like to remind you of several celebrations, commemorations, and moments of raising awareness for members of our community during the month of February: 
Heritage Month Celebrations: 
♦ Black History Month \(February\): Black History Month celebrates Black and African American history, culture, achievements, and excellence. It also draws attention to the lived experiences of Black and African Americans within the United States, including by celebrating Black and African American communities and creating awareness about issues these communities face. This celebration began in the United States in 1926, when Association for the Study of African American Life and History \(ASALH\) head Dr. Carter G. Woodson recommended that schools use the second week of February—which holds the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass—to ensure students are exposed to Black history. Fifty years later, this week was expanded into a month-long celebration. Every president since 1976 has proclaimed February to be Black History Month. 
The theme for this year’s Black History Month is “African Americans and Labor.” According to ASALH, this theme centralizes “the various and profound ways that work and working of all kinds – free and unfree, skilled, and unskilled, vocational and voluntary – intersect with the collective experiences of Black people... It intends to encourage broad reflections on intersections between Black people’s work and their workplaces in all their iterations and key moments, themes, and events in Black history and culture across time and space and throughout the U.S., Africa, and the Diaspora.” 
Black History Month is a time to celebrate the fullness of Black and African American history and culture, though such celebrations cannot—and should not—be limited to a single month. At UConn, we believe that Black history, culture, and excellence should be celebrated every day. The University aims to provide opportunities for celebration, community building, and education through the African American Cultural Center \(AACC\) and Africana Studies Institute.](https://production.wordpress.uconn.edu/diversitydraft/wp-content/uploads/sites/3257/sb-instagram-feed-images/475875113_18266550454250914_4810565915065587742_nfull.webp) ](https://diversity.uconn.edu/<https:/www.instagram.com/p/DFlf9-hhUhw/>)
