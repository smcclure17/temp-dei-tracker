#  Racial Justice Program 
### About the Program
The FXB Center aims to create an actionable field of scholarship examining the impact of structural racism on health and builds ties with our neighbors – community organizations, decision-makers, media, and government partners – to ensure this research appears not only in academic journals but is also communicated in ways that help guide change.
The FXB Center’s Structural Racism Initiative for Diversity with Equity (STRIDE) uses practice-oriented research to deepen the knowledge base and to fill gaps in content and methodology. Its activities have included support for post-doctoral research on how racism harms health, student internships with community organizations, and a project focused on the potential public health [impact of monetary reparations for African enslavement](https://fxb.harvard.edu/racial-justice/racial-justice-program/<https:/fxb.harvard.edu/racial-justice/reparations/>).
Research brings together scholars and practitioners to investigate several mutually reinforcing areas through which racial health inequities are perpetuated. Topics include:
  * Addressing the adverse perinatal impacts for Black-birthing people residing in resource-deprived neighborhoods over their life course
  * Impact of parental incarceration on children
  * Racial bias training in medical education and clinical practice, race-based medicine, algorithmic bias, and health policy.
  * Housing discrimination and neighborhood segregation
  * Environmental practices and climate justice
  * Novel ways of monitoring health outcomes on the neighborhood level using wastewater sampling


Beyond the moral imperative of achieving equity, what public health can add to the call to end structural racism is data that will inform life-saving actions and decisions at the structural level. The FXB Center believes research on structural racism can help quantify the cost of inaction and provide the needed evidence to reform existing structures and practices.

### Community-based Internship Placements
Community-based internship placements are a component of the FXB Center’s STRIDE Program designed to build, strengthen, and sustain our relationships with communities working to address structural racism in health. Through these internships, we place doctoral students in community-driven projects focused on combating the various ways structural racism impacts health.
We prioritize partnerships with grassroots community-based organizations and community-based groups in the Greater Boston area, while also collaborating with a diverse range of organizations, including national advocacy groups and local public health departments. This internship opportunity provides students with hands-on experience in community-engaged practice while contributing to meaningful, community-led efforts toward racial and social justice.
​Since 2019, the FXB Center has helped place and support PhD students in organizations that work to serve children’s needs such as: 
  * **​Friends of the Children-Boston:** The internship was created to serve Friends of the Children by developing a mental health needs assessment and program design for kids addressing psychosocial and academic support during the pandemic. 
  * **​Neighborhood Birth Center (NBC):** The Neighborhood Birth Center (NBC) in Boston is working to develop a sustainable nonprofit community birth center model given that birth centers currently face a wide array of policy barriers and thus often rely on personal financing from midwives to operate. 
  * **​Somali Parents Advocacy Center for Education (SPACE):** The project involved conducting research to understand how well Somali families in the Greater Boston area comprehend their child’s abilities in the context of the new Individualized Education Program (IEP) forms. 
  * **​Citizens for Juvenile Justice:** This research project aimed to document and support the delivery of high-quality, age, gender and culturally appropriate healthcare for children in criminal justice detention globally. 
  * **​New England Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Unit (PEHSU):** The mission of this non-profit is to address the community’s needs through providing medical services, advice, and educating the community on environmental conditions that influence reproductive and children’s health. The project helped build capacity and spur efforts related to community collaboration, education, outreach, and advocacy through the lens of environmental justice (e.g. youth programming, mobile medical services). 
  * **​Resilient Sisterhood Project:** The project involved a literature review focused on the structural drivers of early puberty which disproportionately impact Black girls. This research will support future programming focused on education and resources surrounding this inequity. 
  * **Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC):** Projects included a five-session Farm to Early Care and Education (Farm to ECE) Learning Collaborative for early childcare educators to promote young children’s healthy eating and access to fresh local produce through an interactive educator training.
