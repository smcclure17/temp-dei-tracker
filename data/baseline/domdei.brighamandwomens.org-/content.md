### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
The Department of Medicine is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and antiracism work. We are focused on promoting culture change and community building, enhancing recruitment and retention, and advancing the careers of underrepresented in medicine (URiM) residents, fellows, and faculty as well as Asian and women faculty and trainees.
## Mission
The BWH Department of Medicine is committed to being a national leader advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion for faculty, residents, fellows, medical students, and staff in the context of compassionate cutting-edge patient care, groundbreaking research, and outstanding medical education, while effectively partnering with our surrounding communities. We recognize and seek to mitigate health inequities that pervade our society as a result of longstanding racism, sexism, and other systems of oppression. We do this work through innovative research, health equity-focused clinical innovations, and equity-informed medical education.

URiM Internship Applicant Second Look Event – On Friday, January 26, 2024, we hosted one of our largest events of the year, the URiM Internship Applicant Second Look Event! This year, we interviewed over 140 URiM applicants to our Medicine program, and invited all of them to return (virtually) to learn even more about the resources available for URiM residents, our culture and community, and the day-to-day experience of URiM residents and faculty in our program. 
This year’s keynote speaker was George Ruiz, M.D., M.B.A., System Chief of Cardiology for Geisinger Health, and a distinguished URiM alumnus of our residency program. Dr. Ruiz taught Morning Report with our residents, did a Q&A session with our Second Look participants, and gave a compelling Medical Grand Rounds presentation, “[Catching the Wind – Leading Organizations During Times of Great Change](https://domdei.brighamandwomens.org/<https:/bwhedtech.media.partners.org/programs/mgr/>).”
**Annual URiM Resident Retreat** – On Thursday, April 11, 2024, we hosted our 4th annual Department of Medicine URiM Retreat under the theme “Strategizing Your Career Advancement and Professional Development”. Dr. Valerie Stone, Dr. Nicolette Rodriguez, and Dr. Zainab Jaji from our DOM DEI Leadership Team delivered insightful presentations, on leadership careers and building networks. Amidst the elegant setting, participants engaged in vibrant discussions, fostering connections and exchanging ideas to propel personal and professional growth, while reaffirming our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion in medicine.
