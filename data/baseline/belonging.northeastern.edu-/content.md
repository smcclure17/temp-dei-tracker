# Belonging at Northeastern
Fostering a community of belonging is essential to the advancement of Northeastern University’s mission of teaching and research. Our university is stronger as a result of the varied backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives that all members of our global community bring to the pursuit of knowledge. Embracing this pluralism is not the work of one office, department, or academic unit. It is a shared responsibility that spans disciplines and boundaries. By harnessing the power of our differences, we will continue to light the path to bold new ideas and life-changing discoveries.

Our reimagined approach centers on embracing the experiences of individuals across the global university system to maximize impact at the institutional level. This involves offering trainings and workshops, encouraging participation in our affinity groups, sharing best practices, and using data to inform how we focus our resources and our work.
