The Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Review Committee reviews maternal deaths, studies the incidence of pregnancy complications, and makes recommendations to improve maternal outcomes and prevent mortality.
Birthing people in the United States are more likely to die from childbirth or pregnancy-related causes than those in high-income countries. Data from Maternal Mortality Review Committees indicate that 84% of US pregnancy-related deaths are preventable. Furthermore, racial inequities persist as the risk of pregnancy-related deaths for Black birthing people is three to four times higher than that of white birthing people.
